			<h2>From Rustic Roots </h2>

			<p>
					Hello, my name is Brady Blair, and I'm a tech-savvy engineer from Martinsburg, West Virginia. But these days, you can find me in the Colorado mountains and loving every minute of it!
					<br /><br />
					I got a job as a Lead Engineer for an LED screen startup after college. However, the programming bug bit me in 2020, and I've been hooked ever since
			</p>

			<p>
					When I'm not at my computer, I like to spend time with my girlfriend, Sarah Rose. We share a passion for technology and currently have one cat, a sweet 18-year-old gentleman named Bubba (=^._.^=) ᵐᵉᵒʷˎˊ˗
					<br /><br />
					I enjoy creating and discovering new things, particularly when they involve technology and programming. So, let's nerd out and create something awesome together!
